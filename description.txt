 level 1 security:- in this first we rendered home ,login and register page with get http verb request and then wee rendered
secrets page in login and register with post http verb request. and for that we will create a new user inside register and for
login we will check their password by using findOne method for finding that user with condition email:username(req.body.username)
 and then we will compare foundUser.password with req.body.password and if result becomes true then that person can excess the
secrets page .

level 2 security(encryption):- In this we will install mongoose-encryption in our package and then we will encrypt our fields
like password etc. and it will encrypt our code at save() and decrypt that field at find(). so now it will convert our encrypted
fields in binary text which is hard to crack the password ,now our password is no more visible in plain text. But also if someone
got access to our DB and our app.js file then with decrypt plugin he/she can decrypt our encrypted fields . so to prevent from this
we will use environment variables.
